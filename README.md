# 2D-Virtual-Tryon
Simulate, analyse and compare the recent and most widely used Virtual Tryon algorithms(PFAFN, ACGPN and CP-VTON+)
## Objectives
- To design an algorithm such that given with a pair of human image and a target cloth image produces a human image wearing the target clothes.
- To Perform realistic rendering of clothes.
- To compare algorithms such as PFAFN, CP-VTON+ and ACGPN for different types of images.
## Methodology
